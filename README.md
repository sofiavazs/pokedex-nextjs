## Styling
 Styling was done with styled components (CSS-in-JS) with responsive design in mind. My approach was to keep the styled components within the component they're being used - in the future I would like to extract some of them and make them reusable so they can be used globally.

## Accessibility
Accessibility checks performed with lighthouse, accessible navigation done manually.
